Extra practice problems for the online Coursera course 
**"Programming Languages", Part A** by University of Washington.

<p>This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. 
The course uses the languages</p> 
<li>ML</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>and Ruby </li>
<p>as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.</p>
